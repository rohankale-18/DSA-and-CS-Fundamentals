1. By default access modifiers are private
2. A default constructor by the name of class is always called when a new object is formed.
3. We can create a custom constructor with the same name. For given example below it will be:
    class abc{
        ......
        abc(){    custom constructor
            your code 
        }
        ......
    }
4. Parameterised Constructor
    class abc{
        .....
        abc(int x){
            this->x=x;
        }
        .....
    }
   this keyword has the address stored to the object created, its basically a pointer
5. We can have multiple constructor in one class based on the number of parameters passed during initialization
    class abc{
        ......
        abc(){    custom constructor
            your code 
        }
        ......
        abc(int x){
            this->x=x;
        }
        .....
        abc(int x,char y){
            this->x=x;
            this->y=y;
        }
        .....
    }
6. There is a default constructor when a class is created. If we create a constructor ourself the default one is destroyed and if we remove our constructor it won't be restored. So making constructor should be done carefully.

7. Copy constructor makes new object with same properties. we can create our own copy constructors.
8. There is default copy constructor which if replaced cannot be restored. similar to point 6.
